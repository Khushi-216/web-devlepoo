The theme for <strong>Xenith 2020</strong> was <em>Glitches to Perfection</em> and was scheduled for 17 and 18 January. During the two days, several events were organized.<br>

Xenith 2020 marked it's beginning by inaugurating the exhibition titled <mark>A Glitch in Time</mark> by respectable <i>Principal Dr Rajendra Shinde.</i> An exhibition showcasing the project work of the students was open to everyone for the entire day. The projects displayed included: <u>A Dancing Robot, unity based games, a model Rocket, gesture recognition sensors, a 3D printer and much more.</u> It was received with much appreciation from students as well as teachers from the entire college<br>

The first talk of the fest was conducted by Dr Paritosh K. Pandya, an Indian Computer Scientist and a Researcher at TIFR, on the topic <cite> ‘Intelligent Processing of Indian Music: where technology meets music’. </cite> This highly interesting and well-received session witnessed a discussion about applying computational learning and <abbr tilte="Digital Signal Processing">DSP</abbr> techniques to Indian classical music. 

Succeeding this, Xenith was honoured to have Dr Subhasis Chauduri, the director of IIT Bombay, for his talk on the topic: <cite>‘Higher Education: the perspective of an Administrator’</cite> which gave a broader and better perspective on pursuing higher studies as a college graduate and attracted an audience in large numbers.

Apart from these educational and insightful talk, Day 1 also included innovative and challenging events where students from different colleges of Mumbai participated. <dfn>Bot The Builder</dfn>, a gameshow event was held to challenge players’ wit, logical skills and teamwork. It included teams of two building their robot, metaphorically, with the help of challenging clues, solving demanding tasks, coming up with creative ideas, great team spirit and enthusiasm.

A Treasure Hunt named <big>Glitch Don't Hitch</big> was also organized for people with wanderlust. Participants had to face draining physical tasks as well as <sup>mind-boggling</sup> clues to crack and test out one's knowledge about Fort, Mumbai.
